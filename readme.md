# Overview

{Provide a description of the data set that you are analyzing. Include the link of where you obtained the data.}

This data set I found and downloaded contains the median house prices accross the U.S. in the past 16 years. It is organized in columns by date, then organized in rows by location. It is specific enough to where most big cities in the nation are in the data set

The purpose of this software was to learn how to maniuplate data and be able to use other libraries in Python to learn how to manipulate this data. This program is also here to help epople who are trying to learn where they can live based on the prices of houses.

# Development Environment

I developed this software using Python, Pandaspy, numpy, and CustomTKinter which is a GUI library in python.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Add more customization and UI design to the GUI
- I will add a way to compare the housing prices to weather patterns in a certain area.
